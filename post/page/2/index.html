            4 weeks in and I broke my self-imposed rule of publishing weeknotes by Sunday night. But that&rsquo;s OK because fuck all happened this week anyway, just busywork and stress. No progress on keyboard - although some very nice chap from one of the Discord servers I&rsquo;m in sent me a couple of ai03&rsquo;s unified daughterboards which I&rsquo;m keen to play with. Having them means that I no longer need to really think about how to wire up a USB-C port correctly, and that I am far less restricted about where to position the port in the case than I would be if it was directly attached to the PCB, so that&rsquo;s exciting.

            At some point this week Phoebe wanted to watch videos of Volcanos and Thunderstorms. We sat down together to try and find some videos. We watched a lot of educational content which was fun - but then got utterly side-tracked with this 30 day timelapse from the roof of a container ship. She was just as hooked as me! I&rsquo;ve watched this a bunch of times since then and it may just be the most captivating 10 minutes of YouTube I&rsquo;ve ever seen.

            I failed to take many notes this week so I&rsquo;m going to be doing this from memory. Honestly not a ringing endorsement of my ability to keep up this weeknotes thing, but at least this post made it onto the internet on time so maybe that&rsquo;s enough for now?
  I&rsquo;m still in touch with the lovely man at the running shop. He watched my video, assessed that I do something called overpronating and then dropped round 3 pairs of shoes which I&rsquo;ve been wearing around the house for the last week.

            First day back to work after a couple of weeks off and Slack dies as soon as the East coast wakes up. Amazing how debilitating it now feels when slack starts having issues, it&rsquo;s like a lifeline has just been cut off. I swear it never used to feel this bad. Elliot had his first round of vaccinations this week. He&rsquo;s absolutely miserable - which I guess is what happens when someone jabs needles in both legs filled with a rotovirus/meningitis cocktail.

            I am jumping on the weeknotes bandwagon. I&rsquo;m in good company, and I&rsquo;ve been inspired by good people, particularly Tom, Chris, and Paul. Done a lot of walking so far in 2021, we&rsquo;ve been out walking along the beach at Hythe, and spent multiple trips to Leeds Castle. Leeds castle is our lifeline at the moment during lockdown winter - somewhere that&rsquo;s accessible with a pram, easy to keep yourself distant from other people, fun for the kids, but also has toilets, baby changing facilities and somewhere to get coffee and food.

            I’ve not written a post like this before but 2020 has been a year of firsts so let’s give it a go.
I’m not sure what I achieved last year. I imagine a lot of people right now are feeling pretty similar: that 2020 was simultaneously the longest and the shortest year we’ve ever experienced. But I shall summarise mine, and we’ll see where we get.
January and February started on a reasonably positive note.

            My monitor went bang last week, so I&rsquo;ve been working on my laptop screen propped up on a pile of books. Work arranged for me to have a new monitor which arrived on Tuesday. They sent me an upgrade - it&rsquo;s a couple of inches bigger than my old screen and 4k rather than 2k. It&rsquo;s absolutely lovely, probably partly due to how grateful my eyes are to not be peering over my desk at a laptop screen any more.

            In my last post about mechanical keyboards, I was getting ready to dip my toe into the weird and wonderful world of custom ergonomic keyboards. Young and full of naïvete I hadn&rsquo;t fully grasped the depth of the hobby I was about to pick up, nor quite how tight it would grab me!
Fast forward a few months, and in addition to owning and using my bamboo Redox every day, I&rsquo;ve also:

            Introduction Recently I&rsquo;ve been getting some recurring pains in my back and arms. The forearms, wrists and thumbs particularly, most often noticeable on my left side. It gets bad enough sometimes that it can prevent me from typing, or certainly be painful enough to be distracting when I am trying to work.
It&rsquo;s been almost a year since I started working from home, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever really evaluated the suitability of my workspace for prolonged use.

            The Every Day Carry (EDC) community is an internet subculture that seems to have originated with firearms enthusiasts in the USA and has slowly been spreading out to the rest of the internet. There&rsquo;s a dedicated subreddit, a lifestyle blog, and Vox have even written articles about it.
The basic premise is to think, reflect and iterate on the items that people carry in their pockets, handbags or rucksacks to optimise them for the tasks which will occupy most of the day; often with an alternative motive of showing off the shiny things in the most photogenic way possible!
