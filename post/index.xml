      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally started my first personal site and blog in 2009 on the
now defunct domain &lt;code&gt;theshadowaspect.com&lt;/code&gt;. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to

registered &lt;code&gt;eightbitraptor.com&lt;/code&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;ve been ever since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I started thinking about this when I arranged a short remote pairing session to help a friend work through some pain he was having with his Emacs configuration.
