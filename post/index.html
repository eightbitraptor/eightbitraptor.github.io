            I don&rsquo;t normally worry about signal handling in lldb. I don&rsquo;t often work on codebases that do significant work with them, and so if a signal is raised then it&rsquo;s a rare enough occurence that the lldb breaking on it seems like a sane default.
However, very occasionally I end up in the situation where I have to debug code that raises a lot of signals that I know I don&rsquo;t have to care about.

            I got nerd sniped a little by a bug on the Ruby bug tracker recently. The author (üëã Hi Maple) noticed that whenever they looked at the instruction for certain Ruby code they always saw some instructions that looked like they were dead.
‚ùØ ruby --dump=insns -e &#39;while 1+2; end&#39; == disasm: #&lt;ISeq:&lt;main&gt;@-e:1 (1,0)-(1,14)&gt; (catch: FALSE) 0000 jump 4 ( 1)[Li] 0002 putnil 0003 pop 0004 putobject_INT2FIX_1_ 0005 putobject 2 0007 opt_plus &lt;calldata!

            So, Ruby, for whatever reason, has a bunch of easter eggs hidden in its VM. There is the  __goto__ and __label__ syntax; for when you really really need a goto statement in your program! And there are also a couple of specific VM instructions that you can optionally enable.
To enable all this you need to hardcode the OPT_SUPPORT_JOKE preprocessor constant in vm_opts.h to 1 (it defaults to 0 obviously).

            Back in my retrospective on 2020 I mentioned that I&rsquo;d picked up brewing beer as a pandemic hobby.
There are three main methods of brewing you see homebrewers in the UK doing. The first uses the beer-in-a-can kits that you can buy in home hardware stores in the UK: you get basically concentrated beer extract that you dilute down to the required concentration and ferment. These may or may not have extra hops added into the fermenter depending on the kit.

            I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of music this week. Rediscovered an old favourite of mine: Cult of Luna. I had no idea they were still making music, I used to listen to these guys in my first year of Uni. Turns out their latest album is an absolute banger.
  A friend and work colleague switched to Vim recently, and asked me for some advice on learning it.

            Not much to report again this week. Still waiting on keyboard PCB&rsquo;s so no change on that front.
  Did knock up a quick 3d print case design loosely based on the old IBM F62 Kishsaver design. haven&rsquo;t finished printing and assembling it yet so no pics for now; I don&rsquo;t want to ruin the surprise.
  After a bit of an abortive start last time. I started to run again.

            Well. That&rsquo;s it! Missed a week. Had to happen sooner or later. It&rsquo;s like scratching a new laptop. After carefully protecting the innocence of a pristine new thing, the first ding has been made and it&rsquo;s all downhill from here!
Flippancy aside, I&rsquo;m going to try and maintain a regular cadence with these weeknotes. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed writing them, the reflection has been useful and I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading back on them in a years time so see where I am and where I&rsquo;ve come from.

            It&rsquo;s snowing. Actually snowing, like settling on the ground and making everything white. This almost never happens here and I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s icy and cold and makes driving anywhere really stressful.
At least I don&rsquo;t actually have to drive anywhere because Pandemic.
I mainly don&rsquo;t like the snow because I have the balance of a drunk gnat glued to a housebrick. I fall over almost every time it gets remotely icy or snows.
