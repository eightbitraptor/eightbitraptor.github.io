  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <ul>
<li>I am jumping on the weeknotes bandwagon. I&rsquo;m in good company, and I&rsquo;ve been inspired by good people, particularly <a href="https://tomstu.art/">Tom</a>, <a href="https://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/">Chris</a>, and <a href="https://po-ru.com/">Paul</a>.</li>
<li>Done a lot of walking so far in 2021, we&rsquo;ve been out walking along the beach at Hythe, and spent multiple trips to Leeds Castle. Leeds castle is our lifeline at the moment during lockdown winter - somewhere that&rsquo;s accessible with a pram, easy to keep yourself distant from other people, fun for the kids, but also has toilets, baby changing facilities and somewhere to get coffee and food.</li>
<li>My friend <a href="https://argyllrb.wordpress.com/">Richard</a> sent me a bottle of <a href="https://pilotbeer.co.uk/product/barrel-aged-double-mochaccino/">Pilot&rsquo;s barrel aged double mocchachino stout</a> before Christmas and I drank it on New Years Day. It was absolutely astounding, but at 12.5% I&rsquo;m glad it only came in a 250ml bottle.</li>
<li>I got a box of random bits arrive in the post a while ago from Shopify. A fun gesture and a load of new swag. I finally decided to try the lounge trousers on over the holidays despite being very resistant to the idea of loungewear as a concept, and I think I might be a convert. Turns out that elasticated ankles make all the difference for me.</li>
<li>I wrote and published <a href="/2021/01/03/2020-a-year-in-review/">my reflections on 2020</a>. A surprisingly fun process given how crappy the year has been. It has been nice to remind myself of some of the things we acheived in amongst the quagmire of crap.</li>
<li>I think I might be getting into tea. Liz bought me a selection of Ceylon from <a href="https://www.shibui-tea.co.uk/">Shibui</a>, a super cool tea shop she found in Edinburgh. I am busy brewing and trying them all. I opened a Ceylon Nuwara Eliya, which had largest leaves of any tea I&rsquo;ve had before, but I think my favourite so far is still Ceylon Silver Kandy. Reading up about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_leaf_grading">tea grading scales</a> and man, that shit is arbitrary!</li>
<li>My grandma died from COVID-19 in her nursing home on Sunday 3rd. She tested positive just before Christmas, so we&rsquo;ve been desperately hoping she would pull through. She was 90 years old.</li>
