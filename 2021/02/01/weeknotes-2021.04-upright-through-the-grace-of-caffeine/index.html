<li>No progress on keyboard - although some very nice chap from one of the Discord servers I&rsquo;m in sent me a couple of <a href="https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard">ai03&rsquo;s unified daughterboards</a> which I&rsquo;m keen to play with.

<li>I also ordered some switches (Durock L2 linears in black with 62g gold plated springs for those following along at home). This means that I finally have all the pieces to build my <a href="https://nullbits.co/nibble/">Nibble kit</a> which is nice. I still don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;m going to get the time.</li>
<li>Both the kids are fine. And none of us have COVID. Honestly that feels like this weeks major win.</li>
<li>I drank too much Monster.</li>
