<p>Not much to report again this week. Still waiting on keyboard PCB&rsquo;s so no
change on that front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did knock up a quick 3d print case design loosely based on the old IBM F62
Kishsaver design. haven&rsquo;t finished printing and assembling it yet so no pics
for now; I don&rsquo;t want to ruin the surprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a bit of an abortive start last time. I started to run again.  I&rsquo;ve
scaled back a bit and been a bit more thoughtful about the process. I&rsquo;ve
calendared in 3 runs a week, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with a tentative
cycle ride on Sunday.  I&rsquo;m also running a much shorter distance to start with
and am alternating periods of running and walking so that I can build up my
ability slowly (in the same vein as couch to 5k). I&rsquo;m already seeing some
improvements after just a week which I&rsquo;m super happy about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a problem with detail. This reared it&rsquo;s head again this week when I
spent almost 3 days debugging a problem that ended up being caused by my use
of the wrong bitmap during one of the mark functions (for the curious: in
Rubys GC, <code>HEAP_MARK_BITS</code> are not the same as <code>HEAP_MARKING_BITS</code>).</p>
<p>Predictably as soon as I asked for help and paired on this problem we spotted
it within 20 minutes and I felt like an idiot.</p>
<p>After feeling (rightly, imo) angry about the confusing and slightly
disingenuous naming patterns in the MRI source code, I pushed that thought
away and realised that this was just another instance of a pattern of
behaviour that has haunted me for years.</p>
<p>I can be detail blind, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do to fix it.</p>
<p>Within a work context this often manifests in one of two main ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I finish a feature, push a PR and then spend days fixing feedback from my
colleagues in the form of small changes that often seem like nitpicks. A
misleading variable name here, a typo there, a slightly obtuse algorithm in
that other place. Or</li>
<li>Upon discovering a bug, I go down a rabbit hole for a long time, exploring
the problem, checking the algorithms and high level approach, making sure
that the test cases are thorough only to discover that the bug was caused
either by a typo, or by a trivial mistake that in hindsight should have
been obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I have a tendancy to zoom out and focus on slightly higher level
concerns. When I&rsquo;m building a feature I focus on whether the approach makes
sense, whether I&rsquo;m using appropriate patterns and data structures, or whether
the object graph makes sense, so much so that I lose sight of the smaller
detail. This seems to get more acute the higher mental pressure the work has,
so whetherI am fixing a problem in my code? someone elses code? refactoring a
feature or building a new feature (probably in that order, high to low).</p>
<p>Anyway. I haven&rsquo;t worked out what to do about this yet and it sucks because
it&rsquo;s embarrassing and it&rsquo;s holding me back.</p>
<p>But the first step to fixing a problem is admitting you have one, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I updated <a href="/docs/mattvh-user-manual.pdf">my User Manual</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping this up to date as I move between jobs and as I learn more
about myself since I was working at FutureLearn. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever
shared it publicly before, but seeing as this week is a slow news week I may
as well!</p>
