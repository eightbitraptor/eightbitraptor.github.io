- Starting to get back into the flow of work again. [I can just about remember
  what I do for a living](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org). Heading straight back
  into evening meetings again has been a shock, but I'm sure I will acclimatise
  again soon.
  
- Elliot got sick on Friday and was unable to attend childcare, throwing our
  working balance to the wolves record breakingly early this year.

- It's Liz's birthday next week, so I've spent more time than I care to admit
  reading baking forums.
  
- [This thread, in which user "Doug" provides an exceptionally good diagram of how to
  cut a cake so as to make a slanted roof for a
  house](https://www.cakecentral.com/forum/t/682604/how-do-you-put-a-slanted-roof-on-a-house),
  is one of the reasons I still love the internet.

- I spent some time over the Christmas period hacking on some updates to this
  website. Which I'm very excited about. 
  
- It's now powered by [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) rather than
    [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I really like Bridgetown, the project layout makes
    a lot of sense to me, and it's always bugged me that, as a committed Ruby
    developer, my personal website has been generated by Go.
  
- I've also tried to give the whole site a more "professional" look, rather than
  the previous monospaced font hackerman aesthetic. I'm pretty happy with it,
  and building it finally forced me to [learn a bit more about
  flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
  and how we lay out elements in 2023/4.
  
  I found myself really enjoying laying things out with flexbox, with one
  exception:
  
  On my homepage, the "about" section with the QR code has a structure a bit
  like this:
  
  ```html
  <section class="short-about">
      <span class="mecard"></span>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
  </section>
  ```
  
  And I got it laying out how I want it: with the QR code aligned to the top
  right (where it is currently) and the text to wrap around it and filling the
  full width where it can.
      
  I did this with something like the following:
      
  ```css
  .short-about {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row-reverse;
      flex-wrap: row-wrap;
  }
  .short-about .mecard {
      flex: 1;
  }
  .short-about .mecard p:first-of-type {
      flex: 4;
  }
  ```
  
  Which does mostly what I want - except for a couple of small niggles.
  
  - the paragraph spacing is inconsistent, between the paragraphs that wrap and
    the paragraphs that don't. I had to wordsmith the first paragraph quite hard
    to make the spacing look ok.
  - and related to that: in viewport widths under about 650px wide, the second
    paragraph doesn't flow under the image at all, despite looking like it
    should.
  
  Given that perfect is the enemy of good, I opted to ship anyway. And minor
  niggles aside I had a lot more fun doing this than I've ever had working with
  floats and clearfix divs, and absolute and relative positioning. So that's a
  win.

- I got a new camera this week too. I've been ruminating on whether to buy one
  for nearly a year. 

- I haven't owned a dedicated camera for about 10 years, when I sold all of my
  35mm film gear, so looking at the landscape of digital cameras in 2023/4 was
  pretty intimidating.
  
- I eventually settled on the [OM System
  OM-5](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-5-review), with a 12-45mm
  f/4 constant aperture kit lens. It has a Micro four thirds sensor so I'm a
  little concerned that in a couple of years time when the latest phones are out
  I'm going to regret not getting a bigger sensor. But honestly the main things
  that sold it to me were its size, the IP53 weather rating, and that it reminds
  me aesthetically of my old [Minolta
  X-370](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/193506-minolta-x-370-great-for-the-novice-and-the-pro). I
  got it for a very good price, thanks to camera shop January sales, and
  OM-Systems winter cashback offer.
  
- The only other real contender for me was the [reasonably new Fujifilm
  X-S20](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-s20-review). It's probably
  a more technically competant camera in most ways, and the 18-55 f/2.8-4 is
  widely regarded to be one of the best kit lenses available for any camera. But
  the absolute lack of any weather sealing ruined it for me. I don't mind a bit
  of special handling, but I absolutely do not need the anxiety of going
  somewhere humid, or out in the rain, and worrying if my camera was going to
  die. Honestly I don't know what Fujifilm were thinking - even the XT-2, a
  camera from a decade ago, was weather sealed to some degree.
  
- So far I am really enjoying the OM-5. Although it's become painfully
  evident how little I understand the intricacies of modern cameras. Looking
  forward to learning more.
  
- One thing that I have to think about that I never had to with 35mm is a
  post-processing workflow. I have literally no idea what I'm doing here,
  [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) and the interestingly named
  [RawTherapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/) seem to be the two big hitters for
  Linux users.
  
- Shooting [Ilford
  HP5](https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/products/ilford-hp5-plus-35mm-film) and
  developing it inside a [dark
  bag](https://www.patersonphotographic.com/product/paterson-changing-bag/) in
  the kitchen was a lot simpler.

<hr />

- [A recent firmware update to my Surface Pro 7 has left the latest Fedora
  unbootable](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/issues/1162). Which
  is clearly bullshit. Thankfully almost all the data on it is ephemeral, and
  what isn't lives on a microSD card in the back.

- I tried Ubuntu briefly, but while it works, it's still very much not for
  me. So for now I'm back on Windows 11 until either: I get brave enough to attempt a
  firmware downgrade, or Fedora 40 comes out and fixes the issue.
  
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), and
  [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) are making this
  machine more bearable than I worried it would be.

- Damn! Windows 11 is slow, compared to Fedora on the same hardware.
