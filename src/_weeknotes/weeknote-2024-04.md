- I added tracking to this website. I chose to use [Umami's free
  tier](https://umami.is/). I don't know much about web analytics tracking but I
  know I didn't want to use Google. Umami seems privacy focused and is open
  source.

- I am curious about how many people look at this site, but I want to stress
  that this is an experiment. I don't like tracking that much, and if I decide
  it's not providing any value to me, then it's gone.

- I have tested that UBlock Origin in Firefox successfully blocks the
  tracking. Please use an ad-blocker if tracking annoys you too.

- I chose to host all data in the EU.

- Did you know how [many ways method parameters can be
  declared](https://jemma.dev/blog/ruby-method-parameters) in Ruby? Well it
  turns out there are a lot.
  
- Arron and I spent a good 2-3 hours on Tuesday this week, chasing down and
  fixing all the cases in which these various parameters can be combined,
  especially in the case of `_` parameters.

- [This test is my favourite](https://github.com/ruby/prism/issues/2252) 

- We made really good headway this week on the Prism compiler. `make btest` is
  now entirely passing, as is `make test`, and we've made a big dent in `make
  test-all`.

- We're running an internal Hack Day at work next week, and a few of us have
  grouped together to spend the time working collectively on Prism
  compatability. We're hoping to have the entire CRuby test suite passing by
  the end of it.

- 100% compatability with CRuby's default parser/compiler doesn't feel like
  it's too far off now.

- My japanese homework this week was a reading and comprehension piece. I had
  to read and translate a short story about a person who dreamt that they'd won
  the lottery. And then answer some questions about it.

- Turns out I love this kind of work. It was quite challenging for my current
  level and there was a lot of new vocab (and some grammatical constructs I
  hadn't learned yet). But it was a very engaging and rewarding thing to do.

- We made some real headway on clearing out and preparing the room that will
  become Elliot's bedroom this weekend. My mother in law passed away in 2022,
  and we've been using the room as storage space for her posessions while my
  wife executed her will and dealt with her estate. 

- Elliot is very excited. Although there's still a lot of decorating work to be
  done on both the kids bedrooms still.

- Pretty quiet week this week all in all. I feel like I spent more time working
  on Prism than usual.
