* I've been listening to a lot of music this week. Rediscovered an old
  favourite of mine: Cult of Luna. I had no idea they were still making music,
  I used to listen to these guys in my first year of Uni. Turns out [their
  latest album](https://open.spotify.com/album/4AyosRz27DscmVHTLPpCM0?si=NswyMDCVTbmSLBw42fFgAA) is an absolute banger.

* A friend and work colleague switched to Vim recently, and asked me for some
  advice on learning it. It made me remember some of the features that I love
  about the editor and why I still enjoy using it even though it's a million
  years old in programming standards. It also made me remember just how hard it
  is to explain to new users.

  I absolutely love [this article, by Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/#language) about learning Vim -
  particularly the part that explains the vim commands as being like a
  language. The first time I heard this analogy a few years ago it absolutely
  blew my mind and really helped me understand the way normal mode commands are
  structured.

* [A year ago](/2020/03/11/a-typing-journey-part-2-down-the-rabbit-hole/)
  I wrote a post about keyboards. I mentioned the
  [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), an awesome little open source 40%
  keyboard from Japan that I had been happily using for some time.

  Shortly after I wrote that post the creator of the Corne showed off a
  prototype of a new keyboard he was working on, and it is very special indeed.

  It's based on the Corne, but makes a few layout changes that I think will be
  a nice improvement to the Cornes already excellent layout.

  It's called the
  [Cornelius](https://twitter.com/foostan/status/1306400975024914433), and it's
  a high-end, split-ergo CNC aluminium, gasket-mount 40% keyboard.

  This combination of things makes this keyboard very special indeed, maybe
  even unprecedented.

  Building mechanical keyboards is kind of a niche hobby, and 40% keyboards are
  a niche within a niche. Most people who look at them think that they're
  either a joke, or that they're of limited use, that it must be impossible to
  do actual work on a keyboard with no numbers, and only a limited number of
  the keys that are on a "normal" keyboard.

  People who like their 40% keyboard to also be split and have alternative
  layouts to the standard row stagger are a niche within a niche within a
  niche!

  This means that when it comes to high-end custom keyboards, there are very
  few that cater to this part of the community. It takes a heck of a lot of
  work and a boatload of money to design and prototype a complete keyboard,
  that's machined out of high quality materials and finished well, and because
  of the small audience, group buys are risky.

  There have been a few nods in this general direction: [The
  Whimsy](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=105358.0) for the standard 40's
  crowd, the [IMK Corne Case](https://imkulio.com/), the [Boardsource LP Corne
  Case](https://splitkb.com/products/corne-lp-group-buy?variant=32581510889549)
  and the [Corne-ish Zen](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=109744.0) for
  the Corne users.

  There's also the [Prime_E](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=100441.0)
  which is ergo, but uses an integrated plate.

  The only thing I'm aware of that's actually gasket mount - the mounting
  system preferred by a lot of the _really_ high end "normal" keyboards (cough,
  [Keycult](https://keycult.com/)) - is the excellently named
  [PooPooPeePee Keyboard Carnival Round
  3](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=111567.0) (abbreivated to P4KCR3),
  and that's just a standard 40, rather than a split ergo 40.

  So to have someone go all out and do a full machined aluminium gasket mount
  ergo 40 is pretty freaking special.

  The group buy is being run in Europe by [splitkb.com](https://splitkb.com/)
  and because spots are limited (there are 100 units for the EU region, 50 for
  Japan, and 100 for the US), they're running it as a raffle, where 100 entries
  will be picked at random and offered the chance to buy one. The raffle ends
  soon.

  Have I entered it, I hear you ask?

  ...Maybe.

* Debugging problems with the internet is a pain in the arse. Recently we've
  been having a problem where the connection seems to drop out randomly. It
  doesn't happen every day, but probably on average once every 2 days. It's
  only down for a couple of seconds and then it reconnects again.

  It's bloody annoying when it happens in the middle of a video call.

  I've been going back and forward with [Zen Internet](https://www.zen.co.uk/), my provider, for a few
  days now, dutifully trying all of the things that they suggest.

  I did mention that I run my Zen provided modem/router in PPPoE mode as I have
  a UniFi Dream Machine that's happily handling all of my networking needs.
  Sadly I think this has just given them the reason they needed to stop helping
  me debug it anymore. So I'm off to go and complain at tech support.
