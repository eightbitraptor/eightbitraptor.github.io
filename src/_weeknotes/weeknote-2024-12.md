- I pushed a Feature Request into Ruby for the [new modular GC feature we're
  starting to work on](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20351). Initial
  reaction has been not negative, which is nice. 
  
  We've had some feedback on the PR that maybe there is a better approach that
  we could be taking. So I spent a bunch of time this week investigating C
  attributes, particularly `__attribute__((weak))`.
  
- This put `GC.disable_major` on the backburner for a bit, which is a shame, as
  I managed to split-test it in production and it didn't show the results I was
  expecting, so I'd really like to find some time to dig in to that.
  
- Work gave me a new M3 Pro Macbook. It's functionally equivalent and physically
  identical to the M1 Pro it's replacing, so I remain mostly indifferent. Except
  that I have had to spend my time teaching it to behave in exactly the same way
  as the previous machine, which is bloody annoying.

- I still haven't made it to the Gym. 

  Except one time, where I managed to get all the way to the changing room,
  before realising I'd forgotten my shoes and promptly went home again.
  
  I think I'm going to cancel my membership. The extra time and energy it takes
  to drive into the city, just makes the barrier to entry too high. I just don't
  think I can make it work in my life at the moment.
  
  My new plan is to re-subscribe to Zwift, get my bike trainer and some mats
  set up in the garage. And do cycling and some calisthenics workouts in the
  evening when I finish work, as a brain reset, which I hope will be easier to
  fit in.
  
  Although it is going to mean a reduction in valuable laundry-doing time, so
  that'll need fixed.
  
- In an effort to actually track where all my time is going, I started using
  [Toggl/Timery](https://timeryapp.com/). I like it - the workflow is pretty
  streamlined, although the interaction between the iOS app, the Watch app and
  the iOS Widgets can be a bit unpredictable. I've often looked at my watch to
  see a timer is still running hours after I stopped it, only to then check in
  the app and see that it's actually stopped and vice versa.
  
  It also tends to shit itself in myriad ways when the internet connection is
  unstable or unreliable.
  
  I've only a weeks worth of data, but I can tell you that this week, amongst
  other things, I spent 43 hours working, 33 hours 30 minutes on home management
  tasks (cleaning/cooking/school runs etc) and had 4 hours 20 minutes of personal
  time, of which 3 hours was Japanese lessons and homework.
  
  And this is why using Github contributions as a job interview metric is
  discrimination.
  
- Speaking of which, it was my first Japanese lesson for about 3 weeks, after
  work travel and sickness related absenses and it was really nice to get back
  into it again.

- Travelling recently has made me really want a new backpack.

  I am currently using a [34L Osprey
  Nebula](https://www.blacks.co.uk/15935483/osprey-nebula-34l-backpack-15935483)
  but it's not working for me super well. 
  
  When I go away for just a few days, say 5 or less, the Nebula fits everything
  I need - but the trade off is that it's heavy and unwieldy, and it leaves me
  without a good "day bag". It's far too big for just carrying a laptop and a
  water bottle round a conference.
  
  When I go away for longer, I take it as my carry-on personal item, for which
  it is ludicrously oversized. I usually pack my Camera, Laptop, headphones,
  Kindle, Travelers Notebook and my Switch, and all that mostly rattles around
  the bottom of this bag.
  
  So I'm on the hunt for a new bag. I have a few ideas already, but if you are
  reading this and you have [strong opinions about
  bags](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/), and/or [EDC
  stuff](https://www.eightbitraptor.com/2019/09/25/whats-in-my-bag-coffee-shop-edition/),
  particularly if you're based in the UK or know about UK brands, then [hit me
  up](https://ruby.social/@eightbitraptor) [I'd love to hear your reckons](https://www.threads.net/@eightbitraptor). 
  
  My basic criteria so far are:
  
  - Smaller than the Osprey (I'm thinking 18-20L), without a huge footprint,
    although it must be at least 13cm deep ([the camera insert I
    use](https://uk.tenba.com/tenba-byob-7-camera-insert-black/) is 10cm deep,
    plus a bit for a laptop I assume).
  
  - Top-opening, and must not open flat, like a suitcase, or like the laptop
    compartment on the Osprey, I hate that.
  
  - Minimal amounts of pockets/organisation. The Osprey has way too many pockets
    and sections. I'd like one main compartment, and one or two small pockets
    that are accessible easily without opening the main compartment, for like a
    passport, keys or sunglasses.
    
  - Also maybe a seperately accessible laptop compartment, and a small internal
    organisation space to put a tablet, a notebook and a couple of pens,
    although the lack of these would not be a deal-breaker.
  
  - External water bottle storage. I can't believe how many backpacks don't have
    space to put a water bottle.
  
  - Weather resistant. I don't intend to take it in the shower, but it'd be nice
    if I didn't have to worry too much about getting caught in the rain.
  
  - Vaguely ethical. By this I mean, sustainable/recycled materials; from a
    reputable manufacturer, ideally a B-Corp; carbon neutral if possible; no
    slavery, and no child labour, as far as that's possible to
    verify. Basically, I'd like as few reasons to feel shit about buying this
    product as possible.
  
  - Good quality. I don't want to have to replace it in a year, or two (or ten,
    ideally). And I prioritise longevity and quality over upfront cost.

  - A fun colour. I'm bored of boring black bags.
