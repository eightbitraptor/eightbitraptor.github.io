- After writing [rccgen](https://github.com/eightbitraptor/rccgen) last week. I
  haven't actually had cause to use it in anger yet. I've not spent much time in
  the CRuby codebase. Instead I've mostly been trying to unify and improve the
  [benchmarking](https://rubybench.github.io/)
  [story](https://speed.ruby-lang.org/) around Ruby. It's been fun to work
  predominantly in Ruby the language, rather than Ruby the interpreter for a
  while. But I am missing the GC work quite a bit. There's lots of fun stuff
  happening over in CRuby land that I don't feel adequately involved in yet, and
  it's giving me fomo.

- Thinking about self-hosting my own public Git forge. I've been running a
  little Gitea instance internally for a while now. But every time I want to
  share something publicly I end up putting it on GitHub because the friction is
  low.

  I am increasingly uncomfortable with GitHub's subsumption into Microsoft
  ([CoreAI](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/)?
  fucking come on!). I'm still going to keep a presence there, if nothing else
  I'll need it for work. And it is still the largest repository of software on
  the planet (for now), but I'd rather move my personal code somewhere else.

  I'd use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), but I know
  they're a non-profit, aimed at FOSS codebases, and I want the option of having
  a decent amount of private code guilt free.

  [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/) has a lot going for it: it's EU based, and
  cheap, but ultimately, I just don't want to pay a private company to safeguard
  my source code anymore, so self-hosting feels like the most sensible option
  left.

  Clearly, My hubris has been buoyed by my recent experiments with FreshRSS
  (which is going great by the way, I use it every day from multiple clients).

- Went out to Floc with [Arron](https://untappd.com/user/dunmanifestin) last
  week. The beers and pizza were amazing there as they always are. Although in a
  fit of pique, I got slightly annoyed at all the DDH IPA's on the board and
  suggested we head out to a couple of different pubs.

  Turns out that was a trap. I don't think the White Hart had cleaned the beer
  lines in a while, and I just didn't enjoy the (usually excellent) beer at the
  Foundry this time around.

  Lesson learned. Will stick with Floc next time. Seriously though, it's
  December now: where all my Impy Stouts at?

- I have pulled almost every muscle from my mid back to my triceps, and I am
  moving around like an old man. It's been raining pretty frequently this week
  and I managed to get my car accidentally stuck in a field as I was dropping P
  off to her dance class on Saturday.

  I am very grateful to one of the other dance dads who hung around with me in
  the rain for 90 minutes, attemting to manuevre, rock and push a 1.5 tonne
  7-seater SUV around a field in the pissing rain.

  We ended up managing to tow it out using other dad's work van, a borrowed tow
  lug, a few hastily tied together ratchet straps and a lot of luck.

- Took the kids out on their bikes on Sunday, I can't believe El is almost too
  tall for his already, he's only had it 5 minutes! He's got very good at riding
  it on the road now though.

- I have been out running 3 times this week. I did a 2k on Tuesday lunchtime, a
  5k on Thursday lunchtime, and a 5k on Sunday morning! Feeling very pleased
  with that, and the payoff of watching the sunrise while running through the
  fields and woodland near me was well worth it.

  My legs are sore.
