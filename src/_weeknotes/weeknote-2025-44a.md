- I am sick, again. At the start of last week I developed some kind of upper
  respiratory infection and it sucks.
  
  It's nothing that Paracetamol, decongenstant and a lot of expectorating can't
  shift, but it's bloody annoying. I'm struggling to keep up with the kids, my
  running shoes are judging me every time I stumble past them, and I can barely
  get upstairs without wheezing.
  
  I'm on the mend, thankfully, but I feel like I've been almost constantly ill
  since the beginning of September and it's incredibly draining. I know it's
  probably just the stream of child-illnesses picked up from various childcare
  settings, but I swear it's taking longer each time to shift them. Getting old
  sucks.
  
- Continuing the sickness vibes. Eddie has chicken pox, as does his
  childminder's 1 year old son, which is fantastic, because in addition to being
  ill, Liz and I also have a sick child and no-childcare to juggle this week,
  squeezing in 2 working adults around the edges.
  
- In brighter news, Phoebe had her birthday, and I cannot believe where the time
  has gone. She really wanted her ears pierced, so we took her into town to get
  that done, and I was surprised to see that even piercing has had some pretty
  nice quality of life upgrades since I got mine done back in the day.
  
  No more turning every day (which apparently, was BS advice anyway), and no
  more spiked studs with the butterfly that digs into your head when you
  sleep. They all screw on from the front these days and just have a flat plate
  on the back! Turns out progress is great.
  
- Elliot and Phoebe's joint birthday party will be this coming weekend, assuming
  we're not all still ill. I am exceptionally nervous about how it's going to go
  considering we've invited everyone in each of their classes to it. Probably
  1/4 of the school will attend, plus parents!

- I wrote last week about needing a new phone and wanting to investigate the
  OnePlus 15. Since then they released their "early bird" offers, which involves
  paying a refundable deposit, that secures you some extra discounts and a free
  gift if you then purchase the phone in the launch week. The caveat is that
  they haven't announced how much the phone is actually going to cost yet.
  
  I am someone who's very used to the Apple upgrade cycle; which can basically
  be simplified to: You don't really care, you just want your current phone but
  faster and with more battery.
  
  I don't mean to denigrate Apple by that either. The consumer iPhone upgrade
  cycle of: "buy an iPhone, use it until it's almost dead, buy another iPhone"
  has served me very well thus far. The lack of choice paralysis is pretty
  liberating, and it's comforting to know that you're going to be able to
  migrate data and settings to a new phone and it'll just work, and be as
  recognisable and familiar as the phone you're leaving.
  
  But looking around at alternatives for the first time in years, it is
  _absolutely fascinating_ to me to see the contorted shapes that Smartphone
  vendors (including Apple) are willing to throw themselves into to try and
  convince you that they make the greatest phones at any price point. And
  they're not just competing against each other, their own other models too.
  
  Anyway, for now, consider me engagment farmed! I dropped £99 and "committed"
  to buy one of these phones on November 13th when they're launched, and
  apparently they're going to give me £50 off and a free smart watch for my
  troubles.

- I am quite salty at the inherant bias in charging £99 for access to a decent
  launch offer. Especially as it's refundable if you choose not to purchase.
  
  I do appreciate that the venn diagram of people with disposable income to
  spare and people researching flagship phones pre-launch day is probably almost
  a circle (and probably overlaps considerably with the set of people who
  consider YouTube a full-time job).
  
  But I don't like that you're only allowed access to good offers if you can
  afford to tie up £100 for at least a few weeks.
  
- This whole phone shopping thing has made me realise just how much I actively
  hate the current place we're in with technology life cycles. 
  
  The amount of human effort that is wasted trying to convince people that
  small, almost unnoticeable spec bumps are actually life-changing upgrades that
  justify dropping £1k+ every year, just to increase value for shareholders is
  truly dystopian. Planned Obsolescence, non-replaceable batteries, the
  deliberate evading of right to repair, so many tools that are being used to
  try and force unnecesary spending and waste.
  
  And that's before we start to think about the environmental catastrophe of all
  of this. It's miserable.

- I hope I don't run out of things to weeknote about when I finally buy a new
  Phone!
