- Long time no see. It's been 12 weeks since my last weeknote but I'll try and
  get back into it after my co-worker Andrew said some [nice things about
  me](https://ruby.social/@drewnovo/112649244814557201) on the internet.

  I actually started writing these weeknotes 2 weeks ago with the intention of
  publishing them while I was at the airport waiting for a flight to go to
  Toronto, but that day and the couple of weeks that followed were absolutely
  bonkers so I didn't quite get around to it, so these are the culminations of
  a couple of weeks now.

- We bought a new car. With a third kid on the way I've had to go full
  Dad-Wagon MPV, with sliding doors and everything.

  Liz went to collect it while I was in Toronto at the Shopify Summit, and it's
  great. The kids absolutely love it, and they're obsessed with the sliding
  doors.

- We took the kids to the beach on Fathers Day and just chilled there all day,
  despite the occasional rain shower. Sandcastles, chips, ice-cream, the lot.
  We all had a great time! Phoebe and Elliot each made me beautiful cards, and
  they (presumably with the help of their mother) gifted me a [very nice
  Japanese
  whisky](https://www.whiskyshop.com/toki-100th-anniversary-limited-edition).

  I have a pretty dry sense of humour, and I know that can often come across as
  me being facetious, or snarky. But, without any semblance of irony: I
  genuinely feel like a very lucky human sometimes, and this was one of those
  days.

- I organised a meeting at work with Koichi Sasada from the Ruby team to talk
  about our plans for GC in the next couple of years, and talk about a few
  pieces of outstanding work that we wanted to wrap up. 

  A fairly normal sounding occurrence: except that it was at 09:00 JST, or
  01:00 BST. I am reasonably used to working pretty late most days, say 22:30,
  give or take half an hour, but honestly, having a meeting at 1am has nearly
  killed my productivity for the rest of the week.

  The meeting was on Tuesday and on Friday I still felt like I was wading
  through treacle.

  I apologise to everyone I paired with that week.

- We also had the Shopify Summit, a 5 day conference, team-building and hack
  days event for the whole company, with 2024's summit marking the 20th
  anniversary of the company.

  I had mixed feelings about all this before going. I was super looking forward
  to meeting my work friends again, and hopefully making some new ones. It's
  been about 5 years since I last attented Summit in person, and there are
  folks I work with that I haven't seen in person since then. It was also in
  Toronto.

  The only time I've been to Toronto before was my Shopify onboarding back in
  November 2018, and I remember it being a pretty fun city. It's going to be
  interesting to see it again with more well-traveled (read: jaded) eyes. And
  in the summer to boot.

  On the other hand it was scheduled only a few weeks before our kid is due.

  Anyway, the summary is that, kid remained firmly in place while I was away,
  and Summit was outstanding and I had a really good time, althought I didn't
  get to see much of Toronto.

  The schedule was absolutely rammed, both with company organised things, and
  just personally with meetings and catchups and stuff that I'd organised to
  keep in touch with folks. I think there was one night out of 6 where I was
  back in the hotel and in bed before 2am.

- In music news: I owe my ex-colleague [James](https://github.com/ohthatjames)
  an apology. Our music tastes have a lot of crossover, so we talked about
  music together quite a lot when we worked together. I've always given him
  shit (in a lighthearted, between friends sort of way), about the band [Russian
  Circles](https://russiancircles.com/), who James has maintained, are the best
  band in the world, and I always thought were overrated and slightly pompous.
  Still excellent, just overrated.

  Well this [Audiotree From Nothing session with
  them](https://youtu.be/K_oYQnv4Bsg?si=tc9ZV3Ueb8ktsmLs) came up in my YouTube
  recs this week, and it was inspiring enough that I went back and really spent
  some time with their discography.

  And I have to say: James, I totally get it now, and you were right. These
  guys are amazing, you have my permission to mercilessly mock me the next time
  we meet.
