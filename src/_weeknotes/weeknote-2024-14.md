- This is actually a combination of weeknotes for week 14 and week 15. 

  Whilst I had written weeknotes last week, I didn't get a chance to tidy up and
  publish because I was busy packing for a family holiday.
  
  I spent a wonderful week with the fam, in a large, well provisioned canvas
  building (I can't, in good conscience, call it a tent) in Suffolk. 
  
  For 5 days, we had no electricity, sporadic internet, and only a wood stove
  and oil lamps for light and heat. It was absolutely glorious. We went on long
  walks and spent time together during the day. And in the evenings, we read
  books, and I journalled a lot. 10/10, would recommend.
  
- I now own a sword (or technically, a sword-like object, since it's a
  reproduction for display purposes only and in no way suitable for re-enactment
  or actual use).

  [English Heritage
  sites](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/) sell quite a large array of
  historically accurate replica pieces in their gift shops and for a few years
  now I've had my eye on one particular piece: A sword inspired by the effigy of
  [Sir William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke](https://manorialcounselltd.co.uk/william-marshal-greatest-knight-ever-lived/).
  
  I love learning about the history of Britain - particulary from the start of
  the [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) era and the
  [Norman invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest), through the
  [Plantagenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet) era and the
  [Wars of the Roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses), and up
  to the [start of the Tudor
  dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Tudor) (honestly, I find the
  early-modern and onward a bit of a struggle due to the increasingly complex
  politics that start to develop but I still enjoy it).
  
  William Marshal is one of my favourite characters to read about. The dude
  served 4 English kings, was a key person in the adoption of the [Magna
  Carta](https://www.templechurch.com/temp/new-1215-page), described by the
  contemporary Archbishop of Canterbury as "the greatest knight that ever
  lived", and lead a battle, on horseback to defeat a French invasion force at
  the Battle of Lincoln when he was over 70 years old! Absolutely fascinating
  character.
  
  Anyway. A well timed sale was just the push I needed to buy his sword while we
  were on holiday during a visit to [Framlingham
  castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/framlingham-castle/),
  which was a fascinating place to go, and I thoroughly recommend it if you ever
  find yourself in the area.

- I got around to setting up my old Tacx Flow trainer with Zwift in the garage,
  and I now have a pretty usable setup for doing some cycling in the evenings
  after work. I am running Zwift on my Surface Pro 7, so the graphics settings
  have to be turned down a bit, which is fine. 
  
  By far the biggest concern with this setup is that the garage is a separate
  building to my house and my Wi-Fi doesn't reach. So I have to make sure that
  Zwift is updated and running while I'm indoors, and then carry it out to the
  garage and tether it to my phone while actually running. I'm going to give
  this a while to see how usable it is long term before I invest in pushing the
  internet into the garage. I have a 30Gb/month data plan, so I'm hoping I won't
  have too many worries.
  
  I also need to dig out a spare fan, and set that up so that it's pointing at
  me while I ride. I forgot quite how weird it feels cycling indoors with no
  airflow.
  
  I actually really want to get out and cycle properly now that the weather is
  warming up, but being able to just nip out to the garage for 30 minutes is
  pretty compelling. Thankfully the Tacx is easy enough to clip the bike in and
  out of.

- I finally got around to servicing the car and dealing with the annoying
  knocking before our holiday. Turns out I had knocked the undertray slightly
  loose in a particularly vicious pothole over the winter. Glad it wasn't
  anything major, and I'm grateful to be able to drive it up the country without
  incident or worry.

- In another instance of a well-timed sale being just the push I needed, I
  bought a backpack. I wrote about my unhappiness with my [Osprey Nebula a couple
  of weeks ago](http://localhost:4000/weeknotes/2024-12/33-hours-of-laundry/)
  and I've been looking around for a replacement since.
  
  Over the Easter weekend I bought a [Trakke
  Bannoch](https://trakke.co.uk/products/bannoch-backpack) with a decent
  discount. It's taken me nearly two weeks of fighting with myself to decide to
  keep it, because of how bloody expensive it was, even in the sale. I'm not
  sure I've ever spent this much money on something that wasn't a mode of
  transport, a place to live, a pair of glasses, or a computer before.
  
  That being said: I really love it! It matches almost all of the criteria I
  listed for my ideal bag - with the only exception being the lack of externally
  accessible small pockets; but what organisation it does have is easily
  accessible enough that I don't mind.
  
  The key point that did it for me is that it's made by a small company in
  Scotland, using materials manufactured within the UK. It has a lifetime
  warranty for materials and workmanship and a repair/refurb program for if you
  mess it up too bad. Although, because it's made of canvas and is almost
  zip-free, I'm pretty confident I could repair almost any part of it
  myself. 
  
  This bag will hopefully outlive me.
  
- The irony of me caring about the sustanability and eco-credentials of a
  product I'm purchasing predominantly to use while travelling for work is not
  lost on me.
