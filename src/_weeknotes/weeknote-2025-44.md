- We leave daylight savings time in the UK for another year. And so begins
  another week of being paranoid that I'm late to all my meetings with anyone in
  North America.
  
- I need a new phone. A little while ago I dropped my iPhone 12 on the concrete
  and smashed the screen. I got it repaired under my gadget insurance for a £70
  excess, but it seems that it's permanently weakened now. It's broken again,
  and I genuinely have no idea how.
  
  It's a little early for me - I try to hold on to my phones until they stop
  getting security updates, which judging by Apple's previous track record is
  going to be 2028 sometime - but I have absolutely no desire to throw more
  money at this phone.
  
  I've mostly owned iPhone's since work bought me my first 3G back in 2008. I
  had some dalliances with the Sony Xperia and the Nokia Lumia, but I've been on
  the Apple train full-time since probably 2013 at this point. 
  
  The drop in quality of the software year on year since about 2015 is
  staggering in my opinion, and iOS 26 is almost unusable, from both a practical
  point of view as someone with an older phone, and a UX point of view as a
  myopic human trying to navigate this mess of an Operating System.
  
  Apple just don't seem to be interested in fixing bugs or improving
  performance, or polishing the releases in ways they used to, and it's a real
  shame. I don't even think they have the edge in the hardware that they used
  to. They're riding that brand loyalty all the way to the bank.
  
  Anyway, I'm not 100% about switching yet, because it's hassle. But, I am
  definitely keeping my eye on the [upcoming OnePlus
  15](https://www.oneplus.com/uk/launch/oneplus-15).

- I'm back to work today after a lovely half term break with the family. We went
  to Cambridgeshire, stayed in a log cabin, and made our way over to Nottingham,
  where we took the kids to see the absolute marvel that is [Steve
  Backshall](https://deadlylivetour.com/). 
  
  Honestly, Steve's shows are like [old Top
  Gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i-op1aceUg), but for kids, and vaguely
  educational, and with fewer twats. Which I guess, makes it not very much like
  Top Gear in retrospect.
  
  But Steve still does [ridiculous stuff because he
  can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpFKpUXKbdU), which is fun.
  
- I made a [slightly inebriated
  toot](https://ruby.social/@eightbitraptor/115437105228464408) while I was
  away, which I stand by. 
  
  After our long public transport adventure of getting from rural Cambridgeshire
  to Nottingham and back I took the opportunity to go to the pub in the village
  where we were staying. [The Grafham Trout](https://thegrafhamtrout.co.uk/) is
  a community run pub inside what is essentially a very large shed. It was
  delightful, I had a nice chat and a pint with the volunteer bartender (a young
  man studying architecture at Leicester Uni).
  
  But walking back to the cabin at 11pm down an unlit forest track was a very
  sobering experience. Seeing the constellations in all their glory reminded me
  that, even though I live in a rural area, I hadn't properly seen the stars in
  a while.
  
  The humdrum of life - kids, laundry, work, finances always expand to fill all
  available time, and it made me realise that I need to take some time every so
  often to just exist and breath, and that often the things that seem like
  they're going to drown you, really aren't as important as they initially present as
  
  (obviously I don't mean my kids, keeping the small people alive and happy _is_
  pretty important in the scheme of things).
  
  And after that little bit of self-indulgent noodling, I've still no fucking
  idea, when I'm going to find the time to touch grass, or gaze at the stars, or
  whatever, but that's a problem for tomorrow me, brb, I've got capitalism to
  capitalize.
