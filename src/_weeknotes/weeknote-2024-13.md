- The clocks went forward this week. The 3 week meeting purgatory period where
  the half of my weekly meetings scheduled in US timezones are all messed up is
  now over. Hooray.
  
- It's the Easter bank holiday weekend. And I was ready for this four day
  weekend for sure. It's been lovely to spend some quality time with the
  family. We've been out on a couple of day trips already, and had my mum and
  sister over for lunch.
  
- Easter weekend means that it was the end of Phoebe's school term. I got to
  watch her sing in the Easter church service arranged by the school. We're not a
  religious family, but dealing with religion as part of the education system is
  mostly just a fact of life in the UK. Especially outside of a big city, where
  there aren't anywhere near as many secular schools.
  
  That being said, the community at our school is very friendly, and it was fun
  watching Phoebe having fun singing with her friends.
  
- The school fundrasing fair ran a raffle, where if you won a prize, it was
  50/50 whether it would be a bottle of wine or a bottle of water. To my chagrin
  I now have a 2L bottle of Sainsbury's own brand spring water in the cupboard.
  
- Sadly the extra stress of exceptionally short school days in the last week,
  and minimal or non-existent childcare during the holiday takes some of the
  shine off of this time of year given that both Liz and I work. But we're in
  the same boat as most people, so you just have to pull yourself up and get on
  with it.
  
  We're going on a family holiday soon though, which I'm very much looking
  forward too.
  
- One downside to the Easter weekend is that my calorie defecit has completely
  gone out of the window. Not going to stress too hard about it however, just
  get back to normal in a day or so and continue on as normal. I don't think
  it's healthy to beat myself up too much about it.

- I've been following the latest xz related shenanigans. It's an absolutely
  fascinating mess that we've gotten ourselves into. I don't think I have
  anything to add that hasn't already been said however. So I'll just continue
  watching and see how it all pans out.

- We had some feedback on our modular GC project recently, which has been fun to
  explore. I've learned more about static and dynamic libraries, linking and
  compilation units than I ever knew before, so even though I've got a chunk of
  work to rewrite I'm choosing to see it as a net positive. And I am pretty
  happy about the new direction. I just wish we'd seen it sooner.

- I made a start on my RubyKaigi talk this week. Hooray.
