- As predicted, it's been a busy week. Eddie is doing much better and so I'm
  hopeful that this week will run a little smoother, because juggling
  everything we needed to do with no childcare was super tiring.

- I'm also not sick anymore, which is fabulous. Still feeling a little chesty,
  but it's definitly just residual now rather than actually part of the
  illness.

- Phoebe and Elliots joint part went really well. 42 kids in total, plus
  parents, and I think, everyone had a good time. We hired a science themed
  kids party entertainerr, and watching all their reactions as this guy set his
  hand on fire with a mixture of washing up liquid, water and butane was
  hilarious.

- We were up until the small-hours for both of the previous two nights making a
  giant overflowing conical flask of a cake based on a picture that Phoebe
  drew. 

  Sadly I didn't weight the finished cake, but it was heavy. Turns out we
  gauged about right on the size too - We had neithr too much, nor too little
  left over. Enough for us to have a sneaky bit of cake with lunch for a few
  days, but not enough that I'm going to resent eating it, or worry about it
  affecting my weight!

- I took Friday as holiday from work. Mostly for a bit of pressure relief from
  the relentlessness of the week. I've been meaning to explore NixOS for a
  while and having the day off meant that I didn't feel guilty for sneaking a
  couple of hours to myself while Eddie was napping. So, I switched my Thinkpad
  to NixOS.

  I spent about 30 minutes installing NixOS from the minimal iso, and prompting
  Claude Code to convert my existing Mitamae based configuration management and
  dotfile setup to a nixOS repo, with most of my setup in a flake, and using
  home-manager for my dotfiles.

  And then I spent the rest of my two hour window actually getting the code to
  work on my hardware, reading a lot of manuals and fixing all of the
  clown-shoes code that Claude had generated.

  So now I have a [nixOS powered
  laptop](https://github.com/eightbitraptor/nixos-config) that I can modify and
  update, that mostly looks and feels like the Arch system it replaced. 

  Unfortunately, then the boy woke up, so I haven't had chance to actually
  formulate any coherant thoughts about what I think of it yet.

  Maybe when I buy a phone I can fill the weeknote void with NixOS crap.

- I've been broadly obsessed with two new-to-me bands this week. 國 (Kuni), who
  just released their [first album, Kids
  Return](https://www.last.fm/music/%E5%9C%8B/Kids+Return), last month and it's
  an absolutely [brilliant alt-rock
  banger](https://youtu.be/pIU5OGkZk4k?si=j4DijkelvkFGQdsL). It gives me hard
  mid-90's throwback vibes and I love it.

  The other is another Japanese band Crazy Blues, who I think only have a
  couple of short e.p's out right now, but make [super chilled out, dreamy,
  shoegaze adjacent pop-rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGY5rm3YBFQ) and
  I am really enjoying it. If these folks could sort out an album release by
  next years RubyKaigi that would be great.

  I'm in this kind of mood a lot lately so if you have any recs, feel free to
  hit me up on [Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@eightbitraptor) or
