- [I arrived back home from Washington DC this
  Sunday](/weeknotes/2024-09/pens-and-planes/). We've now finished the annual
  Shopify Ruby Infrastructure Team Burst for this year. Where we all get
  together in person for a week and get to know what everyone else is working on
  and planning on building over the medium/long term.
  
  It was a supremely good time. We even took a team photo outside the Capitol
  (we did not storm it)!

- As always it was wonderful and truly invigorating to be able to work and pair
  with my wonderful colleagues IRL. Almost as wonderful as it was to head out to
  dinner and drinks with them afterwards.
  
  I love the remote working life - I've been full-time remote for nearly 6 years
  now. But I'm honestly not sure I could keep doing it if I didn't have regular
  opportunities to reconnect like this every once in a while. They don't have to
  be often. I think I do 2, sometimes 3 a year. But they are absolutely game
  changing for my motivation and empathy at work.
  
- Washington DC is a pretty walkable city, which made a refreshing change given
  my last experience of being in the US. My Apple Watch tells me I've averaged
  12km of walking distance over the last week - which I'm pretty impressed with,
  considering of the last 7 days I've spent 3 in the same meeting room, and 2 on
  airplanes!

- I will never fly United airlines voluntarily again. Here is an abridged list
  of the sins they committed:

    * Ran out of main meal options before getting to my seat on both legs of the
      trip.
    * Charging for alcohol (which should be illegal on cross pacific or cross
      atlantic flights imo)
    * Having no ability to heat water on one leg of the trip - and therefore no
      tea or coffee for the entire flight. The knock-on effect of which is that
      basically any soft drink containing caffeine was gone before I could get
      one.
    * They also managed to lose 3 lorry loads of bags between the plane and the
      terminal building in Dulles, culminating in a rather bemused announcement
      over the PA system, that they had misplaced these bag trucks, but don't
      worry, they were looking for them really hard and would update us when
      they'd found them... And an hours wait for my bag on arrival at
      Washington.

- I am jet-lagged and exhausted as all heck. But I'm still doing better than
  Liz: who came down with a hacking cough, chest cold and a fever the day after
  I left, and is currently unable to taste or smell anything.
  
- It does sound an awful lot like COVID, despite a brand new set of test kits
  (exp 2025) testing both me and her as negative on multiple occasions.
  
- I arrived back on Saturday, and Sunday in the UK is Mother's Day, for which I
  was woefully underprepared! My kids made wonderful posters for Liz, which was
  very lovely to see. But I feel like a bad person for not having more things
  organised.
