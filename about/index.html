<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Matt. I was born in the early 80&rsquo;s in Margate, a seaside town
in the county of Kent in the UK. Currently I live in Sevenoaks; still
in Kent, but closer to London; with my wife, daughter and our cat.</p>

<p>I hold a <strong>BEng (hons) in Computer Systems Engineering</strong> from the
University of Kent (although it was called University of Kent at
Canterbury when I studied there).</p>

<p>I also hold a <strong>MSc in Broadband and Mobile Communication Networks</strong> from
the same University after my undergraduate supervisor applied for
EPSRC funding on my behalf (and without my knowledge, it was a
pleasant surprise).</p>

<p>I started my career as a programmer straight away after leaving
University. After a couple of years as a junior <strong>Delphi, Visual Basic
and C#</strong> programmer I changed direction. I found <strong>Ruby</strong> in 2007 via a
junior <strong>Systems Administrator</strong> position at a startup based in London.</p>

<p>I moved from SysOps into Development in 2008 and I&rsquo;ve been writing
Ruby for the last 11 years in various forms.</p>

<p>As of November 2018 I am a <strong>Senior Developer</strong> at
<strong><a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a></strong>. Shopify are based in Canada
and I work remotely from my home in the UK. Working with a 5 hour time difference is a new experience for me, but</p>

<p>Previously I have worked at
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com">FutureLearn</a>,
<a href="https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/">OnTheBeach</a> and
<a href="https://www.reevoo.com/en/">Reevoo</a></p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working I enjoy music, both playing and listening. As my
pithy slogan intimates, I&rsquo;m not very good; predominantly because I
don&rsquo;t do enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice">deliberate
practice</a>,
but it makes me happy.</p>

<p>I have pretty varied music tastes. I&rsquo;ve always been a metalhead, ever
since I taped my first Metallica songs off the radio at age 7, but
I&rsquo;ve also got a lot of time for electronic music, UK Hip-Hop and
Grime, Chiptune, Post-rock, Screamo, Math rock, Classical music and
whatever else takes my fancy.</p>

<p>I enjoy anime, manga and video games. My favourite console is my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>,
the most underrated handheld console ever released in my view. I have
the originally released version (with the OLED screen). It&rsquo;s a Shame
that Sony are discontinuing it in 2019. One day I&rsquo;d like to get into
PSVita development.</p>
