    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Matt. I was born in the early 80&rsquo;s in Margate, a seaside town
in the county of Kent in the UK. Currently I live in Sevenoaks; still
in Kent, but closer to London; with my wife, daughter and our cat.</p>
<p>I hold a <strong>BEng (hons) in Computer Systems Engineering</strong> from the
University of Kent.</p>
<p>I also hold a <strong>MSc in Broadband and Mobile Communication Networks</strong> from
the same University after my undergraduate supervisor applied for
EPSRC funding on my behalf (and without my knowledge, it was a
pleasant surprise).</p>
<p>I started my career as a programmer straight away after leaving
University. After a couple of years as a junior <strong>Delphi, Visual Basic
and C#</strong> programmer I changed direction. I found <strong>Ruby</strong> in 2007 via a
junior <strong>Systems Administrator</strong> position at a startup based in London.</p>
<p>I moved from SysOps into Development in 2008 and I&rsquo;ve been writing
Ruby for the last 11 years in various forms.</p>
<p>As of November 2018 I am a <strong>Senior Developer</strong> at
<strong><a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a></strong>. Shopify are based in Canada
and I work remotely from my home in the UK.</p>
<p>Previously I have worked at
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com">FutureLearn</a>,
<a href="https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/">OnTheBeach</a> and
<a href="https://www.reevoo.com/en/">Reevoo</a></p>
