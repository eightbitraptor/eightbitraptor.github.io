      <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Matt. I was born in the early 80&rsquo;s in Margate, a seaside town
in the county of Kent in the UK. Currently I live in Sevenoaks; still
in Kent, but closer to London; with my wife, two kids, and our cat.</p>
<p>I hold a <strong>BEng (hons) in Computer Systems Engineering</strong> from the
University of Kent.</p>
<p>I also hold a <strong>MSc in Broadband and Mobile Communication Networks</strong> from
the same University after my undergraduate supervisor applied for
EPSRC funding on my behalf (and without my knowledge), it was a
pleasant surprise, that enabled me to afford to continue to study.</p>
<p>I started my career as a programmer straight away after leaving
University. After a couple of years as a junior <strong>Delphi, Visual Basic
and C#</strong> programmer I changed direction. I found <strong>Ruby</strong> in 2007 via a
junior <strong>Systems Administrator</strong> position at a startup based in London.</p>
<p>I moved from SysOps into Development in 2008 and I&rsquo;ve been writing
Ruby for the last 14 years in various forms.</p>
<p>As of November 2018 I am a <strong>Senior Developer</strong> at
<strong><a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a></strong>. I started in the Code Foundations team
working to improve the codebase health of the primary <strong>Rails</strong> monolith.</p>
<p>In May 2020 I moved into the Ruby Infrastructure team where I switched track to
work mostly in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> (and a little <strong>Rust</strong>) to improve the Ruby
language itself.</p>
<p>Working at a lower level to develop programming languages instead of web sites
has been a huge shift for me, with a steep learning curve attached. But I am
enjoying my work more than ever. I am predominantly focussed on
Garbage Collection, and I&rsquo;ve spoken about my current project at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_YhDCNeFQ8">EuRuko</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C3bdT6Ri2Q">RubyKaigi</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ifXSPYidoE">Rubyconf</a> (heads up that all of
these talks are iterations on the same talk).</p>
<p>Shopify are a global company, Founded in Canada, and I work remotely from my
home in the UK.</p>
<p>Previously I have worked at
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com">FutureLearn</a>,
<a href="https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/">OnTheBeach</a> and
<a href="https://www.reevoo.com/en/">Reevoo</a> amongst others.</p>
