<p>My monitor went bang last week, so I&rsquo;ve been working on my laptop screen
propped up on a pile of books. Work arranged for me to have a new monitor
which arrived on Tuesday. They sent me an upgrade - it&rsquo;s a couple of inches
bigger than my old screen and 4k rather than 2k. It&rsquo;s absolutely lovely,
probably partly due to how grateful my eyes are to not be peering over my desk
at a laptop screen any more.</p>
<p>First world problems though. The bezel on modern monitors is so small there&rsquo;s
nowhere to put a webcam without obscuring some part of the screen! I know, cry
me a river, right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bought a new pot for brewing beer in. After much hand wringing I finally settled on the cheap and cheerful route and ordered a 20L stainless steel stock pot from eBay. It cost all of £30 and is so thin that the base pops and bends when there&rsquo;s a decent amount of liquid in it.</p>
<p>That being said it does do what I wanted it for and the handles are riveted on
well which is important when you&rsquo;re moving around large quantities of boiling
sugar water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I brewed my first batch in the new pot on Tuesday night and all went very
well. I&rsquo;m able to do full wort boils for the batch sizes I brew now and that
makes the whole process much easier.</p>
<p>Now I have 7L of an American IPA in the fermenter, hopped to about 70 IBU&rsquo;s
with Chinook hops. Gravity was 1.061 so I&rsquo;m hoping for an abv of about 6.4%.</p>
<p>I hit all my expected gravity numbers this time around, which isn&rsquo;t that much
of an acheivement considering it&rsquo;s an extract brew, but it at least means I&rsquo;m
building an understanding of boil off rates on my system, so I&rsquo;m pleased.</p>
<p>And I also set fire to a tea towel. Don&rsquo;t ask.</p>
</li>
</ul>
